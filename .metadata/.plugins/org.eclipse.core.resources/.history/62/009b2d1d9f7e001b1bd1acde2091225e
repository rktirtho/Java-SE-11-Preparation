Review of var Rules
====================
We complete this section by summarizing all of the various rules for using var in your
code. Here’s a quick review of the var rules:
	1. A var is used as a local variable in a constructor, method, or initializer block.
	2. A var cannot be used in constructor parameters, method parameters, instance vari-
	   ables, or class variables.
	3. A var is always initialized on the same line (or statement) where it is declared.
	4. The value of a var can change, but the type cannot.
	5. A var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type.
	6. A var is not permitted in a multiple-variable declaration.
	7. A var is a reserved type name but not a reserved word, meaning it can be used as an
	   identifier except as a class, interface, or enum name.
That’s a lot of rules, but we hope most are pretty straightforward. Since var is new to
Java since the last exam, expect to see it used frequently on the exam. You’ll also be seeing
numerous ways var can be used throughout this book.
