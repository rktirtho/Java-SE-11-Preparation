==> When construct is called, then its goes to field level, if there need any process it execute them. then
    return to constructor block code.
==> You can to assign value on field before decleared. On the other hand, constructor could be declered
    before field.
==> char can hold a higher positive numeric value than short , but cannot hold any negative numbers.
==> o for Octal, ox for haxadecimal, ob for binary
==> int million2 = 1_000_000; this is allow in java.
==> a reference “points” to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located, a
    concept referred to as a pointer. Unlike other languages, Java does not allow you to learn what
    the physical memory address is. You can only use the reference to refer to the object. Let’s take
    a look at some examples that dec
==> Primitive types has default value for class level. But it has not any default value in method level.


==> There should be any character after "_" for java identifier

==> "$" (dollar sign) sign is valid identifier


Review of var Rules
====================
We complete this section by summarizing all of the various rules for using var in your
code. Here’s a quick review of the var rules:
	1. A var is used as a local variable in a constructor, method, or initializer block.
	2. A var cannot be used in constructor parameters, method parameters, instance vari-
	   ables, or class variables.
	3. A var is always initialized on the same line (or statement) where it is declared.
	4. The value of a var can change, but the type cannot.
	5. A var cannot be initialized with a null value without a type.
	6. A var is not permitted in a multiple-variable declaration.
	7. A var is a reserved type name but not a reserved word, meaning it can be used as an
	   identifier except as a class, interface, or enum name.
That’s a lot of rules, but we hope most are pretty straightforward. Since var is new to
Java since the last exam, expect to see it used frequently on the exam. You’ll also be seeing
numerous ways var can be used throughout this book.
